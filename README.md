**Meeting Scheduler Application**

The Meeting Scheduler is a tool that allows employees within an organization to create and manage meetings seamlessly.

User Roles
HR Admin:
The HR Admin can manage employees within the organization. They have the ability to:

Add new employees.
Edit employee profiles.
Deactivate employees when they are no longer part of the organization.
Employee:
Employees can manage their meetings and interact with other employees. They are able to:

Create meetings with other employees.
Prevent meeting overlaps, ensuring that no two meetings conflict in timing.
Notify all participants when a meeting is created.
Edit the meeting details or remove participants.
Cancel meetings when necessary.
Once a meeting's end time matches the current time, the meeting status automatically changes to "Completed." At this point, the edit and participant management options are disabled, and all participantsâ€™ statuses revert to "Available."
